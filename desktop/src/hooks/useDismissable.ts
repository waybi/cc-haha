 * some listened on `mousedown`, some on `click`; some handled Escape, most did
 * not; only a handful excluded the trigger, so the rest flickered when the
 * trigger was clicked twice. `ChatInput.tsx` and `EmptySession.tsx` carried
 * 59 byte-identical lines of it.
 *
 * Ported from `composite/OpenWithMenu.tsx`, which had the most complete
 * version. No floating-ui dependency.
