/**
 * Tracks an element's rendered border-box width.
 *
 * Returns `null` — not `0` — until a real measurement lands. Callers need to
 * tell "not measured yet" apart from "measured as zero" so they can hold on to
 * whatever prop-driven default they started with instead of flashing a layout
 * that the first paint would immediately replace. jsdom has no ResizeObserver
 * and lays nothing out, so under test the width stays `null` and every caller
 * keeps its fallback.
 *
 * Measure a node whose own width does not depend on the decision it feeds:
 * observing an element that the resulting layout resizes turns the observer
 * into a feedback loop that oscillates across the threshold.
