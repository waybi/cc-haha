/**
 * Shared caching strategy for provider model catalogs.
 *
 * A model catalog only decides which rows appear in the model picker, so a
 * refresh must never be a precondition for anything the user is waiting on.
 * The desktop shell learned this the hard way: `/api/models` sits inside the
 * `settingsStore.fetchAll` gate that blocks the first paint, so an unreachable
 * upstream turned every cold start into a full request timeout before the UI
 * would render — and the value finally handed back was the bundled fallback
 * that was available for free all along.
 *
 * So the default path is stale-while-revalidate: answer immediately from cache
 * (even expired) or from the bundled fallback, and refresh in the background.
 * A failed refresh is remembered for `failureBackoffMs`, otherwise every call
 * pays the upstream timeout again. `forceRefresh` keeps the blocking semantics
 * for callers that explicitly asked for fresh data.
