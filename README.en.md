A Claude Code build repaired from the source leaked from Anthropic's npm registry on 2026-03-31. Claude Code Haha is now primarily a **desktop Claude Code workspace** for macOS, Windows, and Linux: sessions, projects, branch / Worktree launch, workspace changes and diff review, permission approval, model setup, Computer Use, H5 remote access, IM integration, and scheduled tasks in one app.

## Desktop Preview

The Claude Code Haha desktop app brings sessions, multi-project navigation, branch / Worktree controls, file changes, diff review, permission approval, model setup, and remote access into one graphical workspace for daily development beyond the terminal.

v0.5.0 shipped a full UI redesign — six colour themes that can follow your system's light/dark setting. All six shots below are from a real v0.5.0 build.

## Install the Desktop App

1. Download the macOS / Windows / Linux desktop installer from [Releases](https://github.com/NanmiCoder/cc-haha/releases).
2. On first launch, configure your model provider, API key, and default model in Settings.
3. Public macOS releases require signing and notarization. Draft or unsigned temporary builds may still need one-time manual approval. Unsigned Windows installers may show SmartScreen; click "More info" -> "Run anyway". See the [desktop installation guide](docs/en/start/install.md).

## Run the CLI from Source

For users who want to debug the underlying CLI, server, or local development flow:

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
./bin/claude-haha
```

See [environment variables](docs/en/cli/env.md) and [CLI setup](docs/en/cli/index.md) for more configuration options.

## Desktop Highlights

- **Multi-session workspace**: tabs, project switching, terminal entry, and session history in one place, with a resizable sidebar.
- **Branch / Worktree launch**: choose a repository branch and decide whether to use the current working tree or an isolated Worktree.
- **Review edits file by file**: the workspace lists this turn's changes; open any file for a syntax-highlighted diff, or undo the whole turn.
- **Five permission modes**: from "ask every time" to "skip permissions" — risky commands, tool calls, and follow-up questions are all approved in the GUI.
- **Bring your own model**: sign in to Claude, ChatGPT, or Grok; use presets for DeepSeek, Kimi, Zhipu GLM and others; or point it at LM Studio and Ollama running locally.
- **Six colour themes**: white, paper, warm classic, celadon, ink night, and ink blue — optionally following your system's light/dark setting.
- **Skill marketplace**: discover, preview, and install third-party skills from ClawHub / SkillHub, with source and safety status shown up front.
- **Session activity panel**: track task progress, background tasks, SubAgents, and sources in one side panel.
- **Computer Use**: let the agent take screenshots, click, type, and control desktop apps after authorization.
- **Desktop pets**: Dada, Huhu, Bubu, and Huihui change what they do with the task at hand — or raise one of your own (off by default).
- **H5 remote access**: scan a QR code to continue the session in your phone browser; locking the screen won't kill a running task.
- **IM integration**: chat, switch projects, and approve actions through Telegram / Feishu / WeChat / DingTalk / WhatsApp.
- **Scheduled tasks and usage stats**: run planned tasks in their own sessions and track local token usage trends.
