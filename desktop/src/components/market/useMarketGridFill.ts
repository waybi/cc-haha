 * cards, and what keeps a card from stretching to a 600px line length at 2-up.
 *
 * The skeleton has to predict that number to stand in for the content, so the
 * track floor and the gap live here as numbers and everything else is built
 * from them — the real grid, the placeholder grid, and the arithmetic below.
 * Held as separate literals (a style string, a Tailwind arbitrary class, a
 * breakpoint table) they drift apart silently: nothing fails, the placeholder
 * just stops matching what replaces it.

 * Measures the catalogue grid so the loading placeholder matches it.
 *

 * two rows, which on a wide desktop shell leaves most of the viewport blank
 * below them — the page reads as "finished loading, nearly empty" for as long
 * as the request takes.
 *
 * `measureRef` goes on the catalogue grid in whichever form is mounted — the
 * placeholder while the first page loads, the real grid afterwards. That is
 * what keeps `columns` right for the load-more row, which is drawn while the
 * real grid is the thing on screen.
 *
 * Measurement is driven by a callback ref rather than an effect because the
 * measured node only exists while its branch is mounted; an effect on the
 * parent runs when the parent mounts, which is a different moment entirely.
