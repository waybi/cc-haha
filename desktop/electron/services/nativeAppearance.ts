/**
 * Keeps the native window background in step with the theme the renderer
 * settled on.
 *
 * A BrowserWindow paints `backgroundColor` before the renderer has produced a
 * frame, so a dark-theme user gets a white flash on every launch unless we
 * know the theme up front. The renderer's choice lives in its own
 * localStorage, which the main process cannot read, so the last applied
 * appearance is cached in a small file next to window-state and used to seed
 * the next launch.
 *
 * ── Why this deliberately does NOT touch `nativeTheme.themeSource` ──
 *
 * Pinning it to the user's fixed theme is tempting: it would make context
 * menus, devtools and the macOS window frame agree with the app. It was tried
 * and reverted, because `themeSource` is a process-wide override with two
 * consequences that outweigh that polish:
 *
 * 1. It overrides `prefers-color-scheme` in every renderer — which is exactly
 *    the signal "follow the system" is built on. Pinned to `'light'`, the
 *    moment a user switches the toggle back on, the renderer resolves against
 *    the *pinned* value rather than the real OS setting and lands on the wrong
 *    theme until an async IPC round-trip unpins it.
 * 2. It leaks out of the app: the preview WebContentsView loads arbitrary
 *    third-party sites, and a user on a fixed light theme would force every
 *    previewed page light too.
 *
 * Leaving it at Electron's `'system'` default keeps `prefers-color-scheme`
 * truthful everywhere and matches the behaviour that shipped before this
 * feature. Do not reintroduce the pin without solving both points above.
