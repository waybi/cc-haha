## Desktop Preview

The Claude Code Haha desktop app brings sessions, multi-project navigation, branch / Worktree controls, file changes, diff review, permission approval, model setup, and remote access into one graphical workspace for daily development beyond the terminal.

Every screenshot below comes from the real desktop app in Pure White at 100% UI zoom. The task flow ran in a real `launch-board` test project through ChatGPT Official and GPT-5.6-Luna.

## Install the Desktop App

1. Download the macOS / Windows / Linux desktop installer from [Releases](https://github.com/NanmiCoder/cc-haha/releases).
2. On first launch, configure your model provider, API key, and default model in Settings.
3. Public macOS releases require signing and notarization. Draft or unsigned temporary builds may still need one-time manual approval. Unsigned Windows installers may show SmartScreen; click "More info" -> "Run anyway". See the [desktop installation guide](docs/en/start/install.md).

## Run the CLI from Source

For users who want to debug the underlying CLI, server, or local development flow:

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
./bin/claude-haha
```

See [environment variables](docs/en/cli/env.md) and [CLI setup](docs/en/cli/index.md) for more configuration options.

## Desktop Highlights

- **Multi-session workspace**: tabs, project switching, terminal entry, and session history in one place, with a resizable sidebar.
- **Branch / Worktree launch**: choose a repository branch and decide whether to use the current working tree or an isolated Worktree.
- **Review edits file by file**: the workspace lists this turn's changes; open any file for a syntax-highlighted diff, or undo the whole turn.
- **Five permission modes**: from "ask every time" to "skip permissions" — risky commands, tool calls, and follow-up questions are all approved in the GUI.
- **Bring your own model**: sign in to Claude, ChatGPT, or Grok; use presets for DeepSeek, Kimi, Zhipu GLM and others; or point it at LM Studio and Ollama running locally.
- **Six colour themes**: white, paper, warm classic, celadon, ink night, and ink blue — optionally following your system's light/dark setting.
- **Skill marketplace**: discover, preview, and install third-party skills from ClawHub / SkillHub, with source and safety status shown up front.
- **Session activity panel**: track task progress, background tasks, SubAgents, and sources in one side panel.
- **Computer Use**: let the agent take screenshots, click, type, and control desktop apps after authorization.
- **Desktop pets**: Dada, Huhu, Bubu, and Huihui change what they do with the task at hand — or raise one of your own (off by default).
- **H5 remote access**: scan a QR code to continue the session in your phone browser; locking the screen won't kill a running task.
- **IM integration**: chat, switch projects, and approve actions through Telegram / Feishu / WeChat / DingTalk / WhatsApp.
- **Scheduled tasks and usage stats**: run planned tasks in their own sessions and track local token usage trends.
